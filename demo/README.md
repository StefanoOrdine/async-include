Async Include Demo
------------------

Hereâ€™s a simple way to try out the demo locally:

1.   Go to the parent of this directory in a shell
2.   Type: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
3.   Go to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/demo/) in a web browser
4.   For a delayed example, go to: [http://localhost:8000/index-extra.html](http://localhost:8000/demo/index-extra.html)
